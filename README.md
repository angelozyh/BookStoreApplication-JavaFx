This project was conducted in a group of 3 to develop a desktop application that allows users to enter their specific accounts
to purchase books. Furthermore, the application will enable administrators to log in to an admin account to update and track 
book inventory and edit the customers' database.

The project was developed in the IDE NetBeans with Java and JavaFX. It is noted that JavaFX will arise compatability errors 
Depending on the version of NetBeans used. Process models were used for organized development with the use of the State design 
pattern for efficient code.
