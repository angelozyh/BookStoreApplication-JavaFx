README.txt file will go over some issues that should be aware of.

It is noted that the jdk and javafx library used for the code will not be included within the project. hence why it is 
recommended to download the javafx library for the operating system to which you intend to test the project. Furthermore, 
it is noted that depending on which jdk version, compatibility issues may arise when running the project. So it is 
recommended through trial and error to find a valid jdk which works on said netbeans version on the os system the project 
will be executed on.

However, there should be no concerns for the demo, since the project being shown in the demo has the proper libraries and 
compatible jdk to demo said project. For any further questions can be asked through email or during the demo.
